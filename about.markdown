# About

## Who is the host?
Hi, I'm **Maciej** (he/him) and I am an 👨‍💻iOS Software Engineer who currently works and lives in Poznań, Poland 🇵🇱.
 
I've been in IT since 2012 and until 2020 I have never met people from the **tech world** who are like me. There was no one to whom I could **relate**, no one who could be my **role model** to learn from, no one that **experienced** the same problems that I did.
 
For all years I've worked hard to be a good **programmer** as if I had been trying to prove myself that I am worth something.
 
I also lived in Singapore 🇸🇬 for 1.5 years to **experience** living in a multi-cultural environment and to practice **extreme programming**.
 
I am proud to be **gay** 🏳️‍🌈 and proud to be who I am.
 
## What is the podcast about?

You might have had this strange experience. Sometimes you can talk to a total stranger but feel connected to them. The moment they speak about their experience and emotions it triggered in them you can instantly feel them as if you were looking into the **mirror**. In them you can see a reflection on what's true in you. You can understand them, because you understand the **language of shared experience**.
 
Maybe you admire people who dared to change the status quo. Maybe you're scared but you want to find courage in yourself to make a difference in the world. You can discover what guided podcast's guests to **make a difference**.
 
Maybe you are like me - a human, scared that is different in a way, feeling lonely and thinking that there is no one alike in the **tech world**. Maybe you want to feel **represented**, **understood**, **alike**. These are the feelings that the podcast should give you 😎!

### In the podcast you will discover stories of people from underrepresented groups in tech and learn from their experience.
