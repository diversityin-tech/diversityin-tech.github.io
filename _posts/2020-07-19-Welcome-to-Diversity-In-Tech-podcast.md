# Welcome to the **Diversity in Tech** podcast!

## Who is the host?
Hi, I'm **Maciej** (he/him) and I am an 👨‍💻iOS Software Engineer who currently works and lives in Poznań, Poland 🇵🇱. 

I've been in IT since 2012 and until 2020 and I have never met people from the **tech world** who are like me. There was no one to whom I could **relate**, no one that could be my **role model** I could learn from, no one that **experienced** the same problems that I did. 

For all years I've worked hard to be a good **programmer**, as if I have been trying to prove myself that I am worth something.

I also lived in Singapore 🇸🇬 for 1.5 years to **experience** living in a multi-cultural environment and to **practice** extreme programming.

And spoiler 😄 - I am proudly **gay** 🏳️‍🌈.

## What is the podcast about?
It's a strange experience. Sometimes you can talk to a total stranger but feel connected to them. The moment they speak about their experience and emotions it triggered in them you can instantly feel them, as if you were looking into the **mirror**. 

Maybe you admire people who dared changing the status quo. Maybe you're scared but you want to find courage in yourself to make a difference in the world.

Maybe you are like me - a human, scared that is different in a way. Scared that there is no one alike in the **tech world**.

### This podcast is about discovering stories of people from underrepresented groups in tech and learning from their experience.

- LEARN the language of shared experience. 
- DISCOVER what guided them to making a difference. 
- FEEL represented, understood, alike.
